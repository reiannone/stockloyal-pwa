Perfect 👍 that’s a really clean direction — frontend owns the logic, backend just persists state.

When you’re ready to pick this up again, we can:

Refactor Login.jsx to call wallet.php?action=create or update directly.

Update OrderConfirmation.jsx to deduct via wallet.php?action=update.

Simplify Wallet.jsx + PointsSelect.jsx to always pull fresh from wallet.php?action=get.

That will eliminate duplication (earned_points.php, deduct_points.php) and keep the flow transparent.

Want me to sketch a migration sequence/checklist for when you’re ready so you don’t miss a step?
